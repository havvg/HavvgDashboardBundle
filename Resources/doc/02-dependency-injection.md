## DashboardPass

The `DashboardPass` allows to simplify the service definitions for different dashboards.

It depends on the [HavvgDRYBundle](https://github.com/havvg/HavvgDRYBundle)
and makes use of the [AbstractTaggedMapCompilerPass](https://github.com/havvg/HavvgDRYBundle/blob/master/DependencyInjection/Compiler/AbstractTaggedMapCompilerPass.php)

See [this example](https://gist.github.com/3098997) on how to make use of the `DashboardPass`.
