# Configuration

The default configuration for the bundle looks like this:

``` yaml
havvg_dashboard:
    # If you are not using Twig, you can unset this configuration setting disabling the Twig support completely.
    twig:
        # The template is required.
        template: ~
        # The default block is a fallback to be used if no boardlet specific block could be found.
        default_block: ~
```
